near cost-efficient high performance computing, analytic, and 
storage services provided by the private sector. 
This collaboration combines three powerful resources - NOAA's 
tremendous volume of high quality environmental data and 
advanced data products, private industry's vast infrastructure 
and technical capacity, and the American economy's innovation and 
energy - to create a sustainable, market-driven ecosystem that lowers 
the cost barrier to data publication. 
<br><br>
Through cooperative activities as a part of NOAA's Big Data Project, 
GOES-16 data are available for direct download from the Amazon S3 storage.

Level-2 NEXRAD data can be loaded directly from the tool.  After selecting a report, the Level-2 NEXRAD data for the closest site and date/time may
be directly loaded, by leveraging the Big Data Project storage of Level-2 NEXRAD.
<br><br>
<p>
<strong>NCEI Station Observation Forms</strong><br><br>
This tool uses two NCEI web service APIs to provide simple, direct access to easy-to-read form of temperature and precipitation
data from the GHCN-Daily station network.  The tool is available from the 'Services' menu.  
First, the tool will list and plot available stations.  Then after the user selects a
station, a monthly form may be directly loaded.  The document viewer allows each monthly form to be added as a new page.  
The user may print or save their custom built document as a PDF.
<br><br>
<p>
<strong></strong><br><br>

now supported via user-supplied metadata, entered when a new site is requested.
<br><br>

<strong>Time Morphing</strong><br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL TOOL: Please use with caution!  
The time morphing tool interpolates data between two timesteps. The interpolation 
can be either a simple weighted average (fade in/out effect) or motion vectors can 
be used to add movement to the interpolation. The motion vectors can be derived from 
the NEXRAD Level-III Storm Structure product available in the NOAA/NCDC Severe Weather 
Data Inventory, or the Storm Motion variables in the RUC Model available from the NOAA/NCDC NOMADS THREDDS Server.
<br><br>

<strong>Simple Math Tool</strong><br><br>
There is now a simple math tool to perform min/max/sum/avg calculations across 
a dimension or multiple files.
<br><br>

<strong>Data Selector Improvements</strong><br><br>

The Level-2 Dual-Polarization moments and Level-3 Dual-Polarization products are now
supported.  For more information on dual-polarization and the new Level-3 NEXRAD
products, please refer to:  http://www.wdtb.noaa.gov/courses/dualpol/outreach/
<br><br>

<strong>Isosurface KMZ Generation</strong><br><br>
The generation and export of KMZ isosurfaces for Radial and Gridded Datasets is now supported.  
An isosurface is a three-dimensional equivalent of the two-dimensional contour line.  
Isosurfaces can be generated from gridded data that have a height dimension or Radial 
volume scan data such as Level-2 NEXRAD.  The resulting KMZ can be visualized in KMZ viewers 
such as Google Earth.  The 'Isosurface KML Generator' is located under the 'Tools' menu.

web searching of the current data type, variable name, variable description or units. 
<br><br>

<strong>3-D Volume Scan Export from Level-II Radar data</strong><br><br>
The KMZ export dialog for Radar data now allows processing of multiple sweeps.  The 
'Sweeps To Include:' option defaults to the current sweep, but can be set to process
the lowest 3, 5 or 7 sweeps in addition to the entire volume scan.  When multiple
sweeps exist at the same approximate elevation angle, the first sweep will be used.
<br><br>

<strong>Command-Line Utitilties now included</strong><br><br>
<ol>
    <li>'sat2netcdf' : Conversion tool for GOES and AVHRR data.  Exports data to NetCDF format.  For
        more information, please refer to: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/rsad/netcdf-access/index.php?name=sat2netcdf </li>
    <li>'cdm-checker' : Checks for CF-compliance of the data structure and determines the
        Unidata Common Data Model (CDM) Feature Type of the data file. </li>
    <li>'ncmldump' : Does an 'ncdump -h' (header dump) on the NetCDF structure built by an NcML file </li>

<h2> Version 3.3 </h2>

<p>

<strong>3-D Google Earth Support</strong><br><br>
Radar imagery can now be visualized in 3-D in both the internal Google Earth viewer and 
with exported KMZ files.  The Radar image is draped on a 3-D model of the height of 
the center of the Radar beam.  The elevation exaggeration can be selected in both 
the internal viewer and the exported KMZ as well.
<br><br>

<strong>Internal Google Earth Features</strong><br><br>
Images of the Google Earth internal viewer can now be saved to disk and copied to the 
clipboard.
<br><br>

<strong>Google Location Search</strong><br><br>
Address, city, landmark and zip code lookups are now supported using the new Location Search 
dialog ('abc' icon).  Reverse lookups are supported by entering a lat/lon string (such as 32,-94).
  
<br><br><br>


<h2> Version 3.2 </h2>

<p>

<strong>Snapshot Layers</strong><br><br>
Any current view may be saved as a snapshot layer, by using the 'Snapshot Layer' button
in the 'Layer Selector'.  IMPORTANT:  Snapshot Layers represent a snapshot of a layer 
as it has been rendered, which are resampled values for all non lat/lon data (projected grids, 
GOES Satellite and Radar data).  What this means is that during an 'Identify', the value of 
a snapshot layer does not necessarily represent the actual data value at the lat/lon requested.  
Rather, it represents the value of the resampled data.  
<br><br>
<strong>Identify Layer Tool</strong><br><br>
Grid, Radar, Satellite and 'Snapshot' layers can be queried with the Identify tool.  Results 
are shown in a text area with copy and save support.  Any 'internal' point layers may be 
used as well, including cities, airports, asos, crn and user defined marker locations.
<br><br>
<strong>Irregular Grid Support (2-D Lat/Lon Coordinate Axes)</strong><br><br>
CF-compliant Grids with 2-D coordinate axes are now supported.  This allows visualization and 
export of irregular and non-standard projected grids.
<br><br>
<strong>GOES 13 Support</strong><br><br>
Support and calibrations for GOES 13 data has been added.
<br><br>
<strong>Improved Level-II NEXRAD Performance</strong><br><br>
The processing for Level-II NEXRAD data has been changed to increase performance (faster and 
less memory consumption).  
<br><br>
<strong>Data Export Batch Processing support for Gridded Data</strong><br><br>
Batch command-line processing (using the 'wct-export' script) now supports Gridded Data.  
Currently, the vector export types (Shapefile and WKT), will contain the point centroids
of the grid cells.  The XML Configuration file supports the selection of variable, time index 
and run time index.  For more information, refer to the Batch Processing documentation on:
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/wct/batch.php .
<br><br>



<br><br><br>


<h2> Version 3.1 </h2>

<p>

<strong>New Google Earth View</strong><br><br>
The integrated Google Earth view (currently only available on Windows), now has a 'split' option offering side-by-side
views of Google Earth and the standard 2-D map.  In this view mode, the Google Earth view is in the 'follow-along' mode, where 
standard 2-D map is the 'leader'. 
<br><br>

<strong>32-bit GeoTIFF Export</strong><br><br>
The GeoTIFF export is now available in 8-bit grayscale and 32-bit real values. 
<br><br>

<strong>THREDDS Catalog Browser</strong><br><br>
The THREDDS catalog browser in the Data Selector is vastly improved.  For more information on THREDDS: 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/ .  To try an example catalog, drag the catalog links (TDS = THREDDS Data Server)
from this page: <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/wct/data.php">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/wct/data.php</a>
<br><br>

<strong>Drag and Drop</strong><br><br>
Links from web browsers and other application may be dragged and dropped onto the main viewer or data selector window
to list the available data in the Data Selector.  In addition, files and/or directories may be dragged and dropped from the File Explorer 
window (Windows Explorer, Mac Finder, etc...).
<br><br><br>

Bugfix release 3.1.1: <br>
Improvements on data filtering. 
<br><br>
Bugfix release 3.1.2: <br>
KMZ export bugs.
<br><br>
Bugfix release 3.1.3: <br>
Frame export bug fixed for 'loaded' animations.  Rock animation export now works correctly.
Accidental data filtering bug fixed (filtered data less than 0 by default). Added better legend support for 'no data' found.
<br><br>
Bugfix release 3.1.4: <br>
Added better user interface integration of cache controls.
Fixed bug that was y-axis flipping grids with reverse longitude coordinate variables.
<br><br>

<h2> Version 3.0 </h2>

<p>

<strong>Gridded Data Support</strong><br><br>
All CF-compliant Gridded Data (NetCDF 3/4, GRIB, HDF, GINI, GEMPAK) is now supported.  All projections are supported and data is automatically resampled onto
an unprojected lat/lon grid using nearest neighbor.  Currently 2-dimensional coordinate variables (such as Swath or irregularly spaced grid) are not supported.  
<br><br>

<strong>Google Earth Integration (Windows Only):</strong><br><br>
A fully functional Google Earth browser is now integrated into the Toolkit.  The user will prompted to download and install the Google Earth API plugin
the first time the view is used.  When this view is enabled, data is rendered directly onto Google Earth.  The export of KMZ files is still supported
for snapshots and time animations.  Work is being done to provide this support for the Mac, while the Google Earth API is not currently available for Unix/Linux.
<br><br>

<strong>'All Files' support:</strong><br><br>
A checkbox in the Data Selector now controls the recognized file format filtering.  If the 'All Files' selection is used, non-recognized files will
be visible in the Data Selector.  The Data Type dropdown menu can be used to specify the format of these files when attempting to load.
<br><br>

<strong>OPeNDAP support:</strong><br><br>
Remote gridded files may be accessed using OPeNDAP.  This is ideal for very large datasets since only the desired 'slice' (variable, time, height, etc...) is transferred.
<br><br>

<strong>Range-Folded Support in Level-II NEXRAD Data:</strong><br><br>
Range-Folded data is now visible in Level-II NEXRAD displays.   
<br><br>

<strong>New Animation and Data Export Wizards:</strong><br><br>
New wizards have replaced the previous animation and data export user interfaces.  The wizards are accessible from the 'Data Selector' dialog
and are designed to be more user-friendly and flexible. 
<br><br>


<strong>New features under development for a future release:</strong><br><br>
1) Capability for user to add custom WMS resource as a background map. <br>
2) Batch processing for Gridded data. <br>
3) Simple 'Grid Math' functions for analysis on multiple files, or dimensions within a variable. <br>
4) Timed auto-refresh for currently loaded layer. <br>
<br><br>





<h2> Version 2.5 </h2>

<p>

<strong>New NEXRAD Level-III Products</strong><br><br>
New NEXRAD Level-III Products are supported including N*Q (256 level Reflectivity), N*U (256 level Velocity), DVL (Digital 
Vertical Integrated Liquid) and EET (Enhanced Echo Tops).
<br><br>

<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong><br><br>

1) Fixed KMZ export memory consumption bug. <br>
2) Increased precision in ASCII GRID export header <br><br>

Version 2.5.1 Bugfix release <br>
Fixed minor bugs with Level-II NEXRAD Legends. <br><br>

Version 2.5.2 Bugfix release <br>
Removed confusing 'classify' option for Level-II NEXRAD data export. <br><br>

<h2> Version 2.4 </h2>

<p>

<strong>Marker Editor</strong><br><br>
Markers are now automatically saved as they are created or removed and restored each time the Toolkit's Marker Editor is used.  
The markers are stored in the user profile and are not shared between users in an multi-user environment. 
<br><br>

<strong>Cache Settings:</strong><br><br>
The cache for data files may now be specified.  The default location of the data cache is $(user.home)/.wct-cache/data, which 
is unique for each user.  A custom shared cache location outside the user's profile may improve performance in a multi-user 
environment.  To change the cache location, go to the 'Cache' tab on the 'View Properties' dialog ('View'-'View Properties'-'Cache').
<br><br>

<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong><br><br>

1) Fixed KMZ export bug for real-time NWS files (or any file named sn.xxxx). <br>
2) Incorrect unit display in legend for TDWR velocity products. <br><br>

Bugfix release 2.5.1: <br>
Radial data legend bugfix. 


<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Version 2.4.1 Bugfix Release: </strong><br>
1) Added CLASS backup FTP site, which is checked when data is not found on primary site.<br>
2) Fixed some of the open files issues with the Level-II export. <br>

<br><br>
<strong>Version 2.4.2 Bugfix Release: </strong><br>
1) Fixed bug with N*S Level-III NEXRAD files display.<br>

<br><br>
<strong>Version 2.4.3 Bugfix Release: </strong><br>
1) Fixed bug in data exporter where selecting All Points Export would set all further exports to be point.<br>
2) Removed 'height' attribute and added 'heightRel' (height relative to radar site) and 'heightASL' (height above sea level) attributes. <br>
3) Fixed bug where time attribute was shown in local user time zone.  Set back to UTC and set format to ISO yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ss'Z' (ex: 2009-04-01T12:34:02Z) <br>
4) Added new enhancement color table for GOES Water Vapor (BAND_03) <br> 
5) Fixed bug in batch mode command-line data exporter that caused shift in extent filter when processing directories and using gridCellResolution setting.<br>
6) Fixed bug in large animation creation / frame export that caused data display problems after processing ~200 frames.<br><br>
<br><br>

<h2> Version 2.3 </h2>

<p>


<strong>TDWR support </strong> <br><br>
The FAA TDWR (Terminal Doppler Weather Radar) network support has been added.  TDWR Level-III products are available from 
NCDC and the NWS real-time Gateway server.  While many products are identical to NEXRAD Level-III, several 'special' TDWR specific products
exist.  For more information, refer to the product list at: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/radar/productsdetail.html and the following
documents from the Radar Operations Center: <br>
ftp://ftp.roc.noaa.gov/PUB/TDWR_SPG_INFO/TDWR%20Map.pdf <br>
ftp://ftp.roc.noaa.gov/PUB/TDWR_SPG_INFO/CONUS%20Radar%20Coverage%20AGL%20WSR-88D%20&%20TDWR.ppt
 
<br><br>

<strong>New Level-III Product support </strong> <br><br>
The Level-III products 'Digital Hybrid Reflectivity' (DHR) and 'Digital Storm Total Precipitation' (DSP) are now supported.
<br><br>

<strong>Return of the Point Export support </strong> <br><br>
Point export of the range bin or grid cell centroid is now supported for Radar and Satellite data.  This feature was removed in 
version 2.0 due to significant API changes.  The 'All Cuts' option is also supported.
<br><br>

<strong>Bookmarks </strong> <br><br>
'Bookmarks' may now be saved which save the current map extent.  
 These bookmarks are saved to the user profile and will be visible in all subsequent launchs of the Toolkit.
 The Bookmark Editor is available from the 'View' menu and the Bookmark button on the Toolbar.<br><br>
 
 <strong>KMZ Launch </strong> <br><br>
The current view may be opened instantly in Google Earth (or whatever program is registered to the '.kmz' extension).
A 'snapshot' KMZ file is written to the user's cache.  This 'Launch KMZ' option is convenient for quick looks, while the 
'Save KMZ' option may be used to create permanent output. <br><br>

<strong>Additional Map Backgrounds </strong> <br><br>
Additional Map Backgrounds including Base Maps and Imagery from ESRI (http://www.esri.com), Color Shaded Relief and Hydrologic Units. 
<br><br>

<strong>Updated 'Interstates' Map Layer </strong> <br><br>
The 'Interstates' Map Layer is now 'Major Highways' and includes major 4-lane Highways and Toll Roads.  
<br><br>

<strong>KMZ Legend Location Changed </strong> <br><br>
The location of the Legends in KMZ (Google Earth) output has changed from the top left to the upper-middle left.  
This change was needed because of the new location the new Time Slider in Google Earth version 5.   
<br><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Version 2.3.2 Bugfix Release: </strong><br>
1) Changed NEXRAD HAS Orders ('NCDC' tab in Data Selector) to use ftp3.ncdc.noaa.gov server.<br>
<br><br>
<strong>Version 2.3.1 Bugfix Release: </strong><br>
1) Fixed issue with the 'T' in the TDWR IDs parsed from TDWR files.<br>

<br><br>
<br><br>

<h2> Version 2.2 </h2>

<p>


<strong>GOES AREA file support </strong> <br><br>
GOES AREA files are now supported.  These files may be ordered from NOAA's CLASS system ( http://www.class.noaa.gov ).
NOTE: Smoothing and Vector Data Export formats (Shapefile, WKT) are currently not supported.  
For a full tutorial on ordering GOES AREA files from CLASS and displaying in the Weather and Climate Toolkit, 
please refer to https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/wct/tutorials/
<br><br>

<strong>KMZ Export</strong> <br><br>
Single, non-animation, KMZ files may now be produced by selecting 'Save KMZ' from the left side bar or 'File' menu.
<br><br>


<strong>Look and Feel</strong> <br><br>
New side bars contain buttons for displaying the Data Selector, Map Selector, Services, Image and KMZ saving options.
The map and legend areas are also separated with a drop shadow border.
<br><br>


<strong>Temporary removal of 'Session' saving </strong><br><br>
Due to several bugs and new features under development, the 'Session' saving option is temporarily disabled.
<br><br>

<strong>Switch in datum from WGS84 to NAD83 </strong><br><br>
NAD83 is the NOAA standard geographic coordinate system and part of the NSRS (National Spatial Reference System).  
The Weather and Climate Toolkit has switched from 
using WGS84 to NAD83 in all maps, calculations and data export.  NAD83 and WGS84 are VERY similar and the 
differences in the data location is within several meters, which is well within the accuracy range of the 
input data sources (Radar, Satellite, etc...).  
<br><br>

<strong>Adjustment to Level-II Velocity color map</strong>
The color map has been extended from:  -50 to +50 KT , to: -60 to +60 KT.
<br><br>

<strong>NWS Gateway FTP support</strong>
NWS Gateway FTP support has returned!  For more info on the NWS FTP server, refer to:
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/tg/radfiles.html
<br><br>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong><br><br>
1) Export of XMRG data now allowed. <br>
2) Classification bug in Level-II velocity and spectrum width products is fixed.<br>
3) Bug in NetCDF for Java fixed for reading some V04 NEXRAD Level-II files. <br><br>

<strong>Known Bugs / Limitations</strong><br><br>
1) 32-bit (floating point value) GeoTIFFs are temporarily disabled due to GeoTIFF encoding issues.  
1-byte grayscale GeoTIFFs are provided in the interim.  If the real values are needed, the ASCII GRID format is recommended.<br>
2) NEXRAD export to point shapefiles is also temporarily disabled.<br>
3) GOES imagery cannot be saved to Vector (Shapefile, WKT) formats.<br>

<br><br>

<strong>Version 2.2.1 Bugfix Release: </strong><br>
1) Level-II NEXRAD legend date formatting for 12:00 - 12:59 files displayed as 00:00 - 00:59 <br>
2) Native format transfer was giving an error <br>
3) Data source history was not current source correctly <br>
4) DPA and XMRG export bug fixed <br>
5) NWS Gateway files in cache now correctly cleaned up <br>
6) Added 'None' option to Satellite legend options<br>
7) Added checkbox in 'View Properties' to control the automatic placement of  the NOAA logo in saved animations and images<br><br>

<strong>Version 2.2.2  Bugfix Release: </strong><br>
1) ASOS overlay labeling did not work<br><br>

<strong>Version 2.2.5 Bugfix Release: </strong><br>
1) Changed NEXRAD HAS Orders ('NCDC' tab in Data Selector) to use ftp3.ncdc.noaa.gov server.<br>


<h2> Version 2.1 </h2>

<p>

<strong>Full Message 31 (Build-10) Level-II NEXRAD support</strong> <br><br>
The recombined data (V04) structure is now supported.
<br><br>


<strong>Improved KMZ support </strong><br><br>
Altitude values may now be specified for exported KMZ files (Google Earth display).  This is for visual effect only,
and does not represent the actual altitude of the data.  Surface 'shadows' are created for when an altitude above the 
Earth surface is used.  Single KMZ files may be exported from the 'Export KMZ' button on the right 'SideBar'.
<br><br>

<strong>Move to NetCDF for Java version 4.0 API </strong> <br><br>
The NetCDF for Java version 4.0 API is now used as the framework for data decoding.  
The Common Data Model layer is used to deal with data as 'Radial', 'Grid', 'Swath', etc...
This allows users to develop plugin decoders to add custom data formats.  Currently, these require
recompilation of the source code to integrate.  Eventually, these plugins will be able to be
loaded dynamically.  
<br><br>

<br><br>



<h2> Version 2.0 </h2>

<p>

<strong>Transition to the NOAA Weather and Climate Toolkit</strong> <br><br>
The Java NEXRAD Tools is being used as the basis for the new NOAA Weather and Climate Toolkit, with support for Radar, Satellite, 
Model and Station Network data.  The emphasis for this toolkit will be simple visualization and data export, focusing on
enhancing interoperability with other specialized tools in various scientific communities.
In addition, the Weather and Climate Toolkit will allow direct access to 
data available via Web Services.  Initial plans include access to the U.S. Drought Monitor, NEXRAD Reflectivity Mosaics, 
Station Data services and more.  The toolkit is in early development and not all planned features are available.
<br><br>

<strong>NEXRAD Super-Resolution Support </strong> <br><br>
NEXRAD Super-Resolution (Message 31) data is now supported.  Super-Res. data has 4 times greater range 
resolution and 2 times greater azimuth resolution.
<br><br>

<strong>Smoothing and Transparency Controls Moved </strong> <br><br>
The Smoothing and Transparency controls for NEXRAD data are now located in the 'Data Layers' tab
of the 'Layer selector' window (formerly the 'Overlay Selector').
<br><br>

<strong>New Rasterizer / Improved Performance </strong> <br><br>
Rasterization (converting range bin polygons to a grid) is now done with Java 2D Graphics API.
This eliminates a previous (and rare) bug that showed large rectangular streaks of small data values
at certain zoom extents.  In addition, performance in decoding and processing (rasterizing) is 
improved.
<br><br>


<strong>Missing Features Available in Java NEXRAD Tools version 1.9:</strong> <br><br>
	These features are under development and will be included in later releases.
<ul>
	<li> 'Point' and 'All Points' export is currently not available for Level-II NEXRAD files </li>
	<li> Range-Folded data values are unable to be displayed for Level-II NEXRAD files </li>
	<li> Improved handling of NWS Real-Time server </li>
	<li> VTK export of Level-II 'CAPPI Cubes' </li>
</ul>
